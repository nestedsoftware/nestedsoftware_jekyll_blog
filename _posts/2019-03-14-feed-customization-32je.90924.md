I recently read this article by @mortoray:

It made me think about a tweak I wouldn't mind seeing for the main feed of articles here on dev.to. I think there is one big cleaving point for articles, namely whether they are _technical_ or _non-technical_. Currently my feeling is that the main feed tends to give a bit of an advantage to non-technical articles, articles about career, personal growth, culture, things like that.  I don't have a problem with such articles in general, I've even written a few of my own, but for me personally, I'd prefer to see more technical articles.

My suggestion is to create a "dial" in the profile settings, which can be tuned from non-technical to technical. This dial, in addition to the one indicating one's level of expertise, would then be used to change the balance of articles that a given user experiences in their feed. The default setting would represent the current balance of articles before any personalized settings are applied.

I think it might also be good to have a somewhat unobtrusive toggle in the main feed. Toggling this on would turn on the personalized settings. Toggling it off would revert the feed to the default. That way users could easily see the difference with a single action.

As dev.to grows, every user will have their own ideas of what kind of content they want to see. No one is inherently wrong or right, it really comes down to a matter of personal preference. I think that giving the power to users to tailor their experience is the right answer!
