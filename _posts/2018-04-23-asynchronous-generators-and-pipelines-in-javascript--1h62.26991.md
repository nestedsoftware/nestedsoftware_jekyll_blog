## Introducing Asynchronous Generators

Both this article and the last one, [The Iterators Are Coming]({% link _posts/2018-04-15-the-iterators-are-coming-symboliterator-and-symbolasynciterator-in-javascript-hj.26637.md %}), which deals with asynchronous iterators, were motivated by a question that occurred to me as I was programming with some `async` functions: _Would it be possible to `yield` in an `async` function?_ In other words, can we combine an `async` function with a generator function?

To explore this question, letâ€™s start with a normal _synchronous_ generator function, `numberGenerator`:

```javascript
const random = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

const getValue = () => {
	return random(1,10)
}

const numberGenerator = function* () {
	for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
		const value = getValue() 
		yield value**2
	}
}

const main = () => {
	const numbers = numberGenerator()
	for (const v of numbers) {
		console.log('number = ' + v)
	}
}

main()
```

This code produces the expected squares of 5 random numbers:

```
C:\dev>node gen.js
number = 1
number = 64
number = 36
number = 25
number = 49
```

My idea was to change `getValue` to return a promise and to modify `numberGenerator` to `await` this promise, then `yield` a value. I tried something like the following:

```javascript
const random = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

const getValue = () => {
	//return promise instead of value
	return new Promise(resolve=>{
		setTimeout(()=>resolve(random(1,10)), 1000)
	})
}

const numberGenerator = function* () {
	for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
		const value = await getValue() //await promise
		yield value**2
	}
}

const main = () => {
	const numbers = numberGenerator()
	for (const v of numbers) {
		console.log('number = ' + v)
	}
}

main()
```

Let's see what happens:

```
C:\dev\gen.js:12
                const value = await getValue() //await promise
                              ^^^^^

SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function
    at new Script (vm.js:51:7)
```

Okay, that makes sense: We need to make our `numberGenerator` function `async`. Let's try that!

```javascript
const numberGenerator = async function* () { //added async
```

Does it work?

```
C:\dev\gen.js:10
const numberGenerator = async function* () { //added async
                                      ^

SyntaxError: Unexpected token *
    at new Script (vm.js:51:7)
```

Ouch, it didn't work. This is what led me to do some online searching on the topic. It turns out this kind of functionality is going to be [released in ES2018](http://2ality.com/2016/10/asynchronous-iteration.html), and we can use it already in a recent version of node with the `--harmony-async-iteration` flag.

Let's see this in action:

```javascript
const timer = () => setInterval(()=>console.log('tick'), 1000)

const random = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

const getValue = () => {
	//return promise instead of value
	return new Promise(resolve=>{
		setTimeout(()=>resolve(random(1,10)), 1000)
	})
}

const numberGenerator = async function* () { //added async
	for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
		const value = await getValue() //await promise
		yield value**2
	}
}

//main is 'async'
const main = async () => {
	const t = timer()
	const numbers = numberGenerator()

	//use 'for await...of' instead of 'for...of'
	for await (const v of numbers) {
		console.log('number = ' + v)
	}

	clearInterval(t)
}

main()
```

There are a few small changes from the previous version of the code:
* The `main` function's `for...of` loop becomes a `for await...of` loop.
* Since we are using `await`, `main` has to be marked as `async`

>A timer was also added so we can confirm that the generator is indeed asynchronous.

Let's take a look at the results:

```
C:\dev>node --harmony-async-iteration gen.js
tick
number = 16
tick
number = 1
tick
number = 100
tick
number = 100
tick
number = 49
```

It worked! 

> The `yield` in an `async` generator function is similar to the `yield` in a normal (synchronous) generator function. The difference is that in the regular version, `yield` produces a `{value, done}` tuple, whereas the asynchronous version produces a promise that _resolves_ to a `{value, done}` tuple.
> 
> If you `yield` a promise, the JavaScript runtimes does something a bit sneaky: It still produces its own promise that resolves to a `{value, done}` tuple, but the `value` attribute in that tuple will be whatever your promise resolves to.

## Pipelining Asynchronous Generators Together

Let's look at a neat little application of this technology: We will create an asynchronous generator function that drives another one to produce statistics on an asynchronous stream of numbers. 

This kind of pipeline can be used to perform arbitrary transformations on asynchronous data streams.

First we'll write an asynchronous generator that produces an endless stream of values. Every second it generates a random value between 0 and 100:

```javascript
const random = (min, max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min

const asyncNumberGenerator = async function* () {
	while (true) {
		const randomValue = random(0,100)

		const p = new Promise(resolve=>{
			setTimeout(()=>resolve(randomValue), 1000)
		})		

		yield p
	}
}
```

Now we'll write a function, `createStatsReducer`. This function returns a callback function, `exponentialStatsReducer`, that will be used to iteratively calculate the [exponential moving average]({% link _posts/2018-04-04-exponential-moving-average-on-streaming-data-4hhl.24876.md %}) on this stream of data:

```javascript
const createStatsReducer = alpha => { 
	const beta = 1 - alpha

	const exponentialStatsReducer = (newValue, accumulator) => {
	    const redistributedMean = beta * accumulator.mean

	    const meanIncrement = alpha * newValue

	    const newMean = redistributedMean + meanIncrement

	    const varianceIncrement = alpha * (newValue - accumulator.mean)**2

	    const newVariance = beta * (accumulator.variance + varianceIncrement)

	    return {
	    	lastValue: newValue,
	    	mean: newMean,
	    	variance: newVariance
	    }
	}

	return exponentialStatsReducer
}
```

Next up we have a second asynchronous generator function, `asyncReduce`. This one applies a reducer to an asynchronous iterable. It works like JavaScript's built-in [`Array.prototype.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce). However, the standard version goes through an entire array to produce a final value, whereas our version applies the reduction lazily. This allows us to use an infinite sequence of values (our asynchronous number generator above) as the data source:

```javascript
const asyncReduce = async function* (iterable, reducer, accumulator) {
	for await (const item of iterable) {
		const reductionResult = reducer(item, accumulator)

		accumulator = reductionResult

		yield reductionResult
	}
}
```

Let's tie this all together. The code below will pipe an endless sequence of asynchronously-generated numbers into our asynchronous reduce. We will loop through the resulting values (forever), obtaining the updated mean, variance, and standard deviation as new values arrive:

```javascript
const timer = () => setInterval(()=>console.log('tick'), 1000)

const main = async () => {
	const t = timer()

	const numbers = asyncNumberGenerator()

	const firstValue = await numbers.next()

	//initialize the mean to the first value
	const initialValue = { mean: firstValue.value, variance: 0 }

	console.log('first value = ' + firstValue.value)

	const statsReducer = createStatsReducer(0.1)

	const reducedValues = asyncReduce(numbers, statsReducer, initialValue)

	for await (const v of reducedValues) {
		const lastValue = v.lastValue
		const mean = v.mean.toFixed(2)
		const variance = v.variance.toFixed(2)
		const stdev = Math.sqrt(v.variance).toFixed(2)

		console.log(`last value = ${lastValue}, stats = { mean: ${mean}`
			+ `, variance: ${variance}, stdev: ${stdev} }`)
	}

	clearInterval(t)
}

main()
```

Let's take a look at some sample output:

```
C:\dev>node --harmony-async-iteration async_stats.js
tick
first value = 51
tick
last value = 97, stats = { mean: 55.60, variance: 190.44, stdev: 13.80 }
tick
last value = 73, stats = { mean: 57.34, variance: 198.64, stdev: 14.09 }
tick
last value = 11, stats = { mean: 52.71, variance: 372.05, stdev: 19.29 }
tick
last value = 42, stats = { mean: 51.64, variance: 345.16, stdev: 18.58 }
tick
last value = 42, stats = { mean: 50.67, variance: 319.00, stdev: 17.86 }
tick
last value = 60, stats = { mean: 51.60, variance: 294.93, stdev: 17.17 }
^C
```

We now get continually updating statistics on our asynchronous stream of values. Neat!

I think that asynchronous generator functions will be especially useful to do processing on sources of asynchronous data along these lines. 

Let me know what you think, or if you have ideas for other ways asynchronous generators and iterators can be used!
